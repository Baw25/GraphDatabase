#Test for set bacon count 

# BACON #
     # -  Kevin Bacon = 0
     # - Any actor sharing a movie with Kevin Bacon = 1
     # - Any other actor = 1 + lowest Bacon number amongst all actors they share movie credit with
     # - Any other actor that doesnâ€™t share a chain of costars leading back to Kevin Bacon = infinity or INF
     # - For a movie = lowest credited Bacon number on any movie credited to that movie or INF if all actors are INF

#give Kevin bacon a score
